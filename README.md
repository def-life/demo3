### having a local repo and pushing it to github

Always include readme.md and .gitignore files that's a good practice and make sure when you create a new repo on github don't intilise it with readme and other files to push from local repo to github without any problem

if you intialise then clone take github repo and work locally just say git clone url and start wroking.

one more thing in order to name your branch main use

``` git  init -b main ```

i.e -b -> branch name as main initialise

OR

``` git branch -m master main ```

i.e change from master to main...
